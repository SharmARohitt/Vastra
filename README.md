# Vastra - Your Fashion AdvisorðŸ‘š

# Problem Statement 

â€¢ The fast fashion industry, known for its short product life cycles and low prices, is facing significant challenges due to its environmental impact, including textile waste and pollution.

â€¢ Young consumers, especially Gen Z, are increasingly conscientious about the environmental and social implications of their purchases, seeking quality and individuality in their clothing.
